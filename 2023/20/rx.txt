rx: wants a low pulse from qt

qt: needs high pulses from bb, gl, kk, mr

bb, gl, kk, mr: just act as inverters, need low pulse from nl, cr, gl, vj


nl: aggregates/influences counter cascade built from 12 flipflops
    db, ml, bn, hk, rs, hh, rg, hr, kf, xx, ff, ql

Those four blocks are all triggered through a single input and probably
have some kind of cyclic behavior.
